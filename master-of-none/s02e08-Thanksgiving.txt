She can't  be around playing cards no more.  Hey, can I talk to you about something?  Yeah, sure. What's up?  All right, you know Erica?  - White Erica or black Erica? - Nah, mixed Erica.  Oh, yeah, I know mixed Erica. She's cute.  Nah, mixed Erica's fine as hell.  Okay.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Like I like her.  I have a crush on her.  Wait, are you trying to tell me that you're  you know?  Lebanese.  - Wait. You're from Lebanon? - No.  I just I don't know how to  I'm not comfortable with the word, uh, "lesbian."  All right. So we'll say you're Lebanese.  I mean, I always thought there was a good chance.  You're the only girl who wore Jordans to the Spring Fling,  and you got those Jasmine Guy posters up for years.  I always felt like it wasn't about her acting.  And I have been dressing like the Da Brat since preschool.  [Dev chuckles softly]  You gonna tell your mom?  Being gay isn't something black people love to talk about.  Why?  Some black people think being gay's a choice.  And when they find out that their kid is gay,  they try to figure out what they did wrong.  Gay Martin's white. His parents did the same thing.  Yeah, but it's more intense for black folks.  All right, so everything's a contest for us,  and your kids are like trophies.  Me being gay is like tarnishing her trophy.  I don't think being Lebanese tarnishes the trophy.  There's plenty of straight trophies.  I think it's cool you're a Lebanese trophy.  Thanks, dude.  Damn, this has been an intense talk.  You want to smoke some weed?  I got some shit that's dank.  [reggae music playing]    [coughing]  [laughs]  - [laughs] - [coughs]  Are you sure I'm supposed to see a dolphin?  I don't see a dolphin.  I don't know, man.  I'm in another world right now.  [Catherine] Denise?  - [Catherine] Dev? - Oh, shit.  - I thought she was going to the store. - Me too.

You got that UID thing?  Okay, first of all, it's not a UID.  Okay? It's not a thing.  - It's the IUD. - Mm.  But you ain't got to worry about me and pregnancy.  You got saved.  - You done come to the Lord. - No.  I don't know why you keep asking me that.  [sighs]  I'm not  gonna get pregnant because  I don't like having sex with men.  Have you tried it?  No.  Then how you know you don't like it?  It's just something I know.  Well, what you trying to say?  What is the problem?  I'm just annoyed that I even have to have this conversation with you.  What conversation?  I'm sitting here being normal.  You acting like a crazy person.  Ma?  Hmm?  I'm gay.  You what?  I'm gay.  I've always been gay.  But I'm still the same person.  [Catherine tsks]  I'm still your daughter.  Nothing's changed.  What's wrong?  [Catherine breathes deeply]  - Ma, why are you crying? - Mm-mm. Mm-mm.  I just I don't want life to be hard for you.  It is hard enough being a black woman in this world.  Now you want to add something else to that?  It's not like this was my choice.  It's just who I am.  Well, who else you done told?  - Just Dev. - Yeah, of course.  You know you can't tell your grandmother.  Why?  'Cause she won't be able to handle this.  And you know how forgetful she is.  You're gonna have to come out to her every other week.  True.  She do be forgetting stuff.  [Catherine sighs]  So how'd it go?  Well, it wasn't my all-time favorite conversation with my mom,  but it was all right.  She cried, though.  Oh, man.  I figured she would.  She's a crier.  She tell you she loves you  and supports you no matter what and all that stuff?  No, man.  This ain't an episode of Growing Pains.  She ain't say none of that.  But at least she didn't disown me,  'cause that be happening.  So  I guess it was a success.  So she's a butch queen?  [whispering] No.  I think that's something else in the gay world.  [Joyce chuckles]  That's a world I don't know nothing about, child.  [Catherine sighs]  I just wish I knew where I went wrong.  What do you mean, where you went wrong?  Denise ain't never been arrested, she in college,  she keep a job, and she respects her elders.  Honey, she want to lay around with some women,  baby, that is her business.  [Catherine sighs]  Maybe I just should've spent more time with her.  You spent plenty of time with that girl.  Is this 'cause I couldn't keep a man?  [Joyce laughs]  You not being able to keep a man a whole 'nother conversation.  - Please. - But being gay  - ain't got nothing to do with that. - Oh, I know.  I just never thought I would have a gay daughter.  Well, get used to it, 'cause one of these days,  she gonna bring home one of her little girlfriends.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord!  Well, I just hope she don't bring home no white girl,  'cause I don't want to see no Jennifer Anistons up in here.  Oh, honey, Becky is coming.  [laughs] And Megan.  And Katie. [laughs]  All right, let's I'm gonna finish the peas.  [Joyce] Girl, it was about to get serious, but I can't date nobody  with a collection of pinkie rings.  Why not? Ain't nothing wrong with a little jewelry.  - You wear toe rings. - [Joyce chuckles]  I dated a pimp once. [laughs]  [Dev] Dev, Dev, get them steps.  Dev, Dev, get them steps.  I can't believe your mom turned your room into a gym.  Pretty harsh.  You know my mom likes to stay fit.  What time's Michelle getting here?  She should be here soon.  - You nervous? - Hell, yeah.  It's the first time my family's gonna see me with a woman.  My grandma don't really know I'm gay yet,  so she still thinks she's my "friend."  All right. Don't stress. I'm here. It's gonna be fine.  Have you talked to your parents about Rachel yet?  No.  - They don't know y'all live together? - No.  I feel like all three of them are gonna be mad at you about that.  Why would they be mad?  - Stupid. - [doorbell rings]  Shit, here she is.

She went to China, Grandma!  Mm.  She lived in Shanghai for two months for work!  And a lot of people thought she was BeyoncÃ©!  And this one restaurant even put her photo on the wall,  but she didn't have the heart to tell them!  [Ernestine] Oh.  I always liked China.  Mm. [chuckles]  You must be really smart.  Oh.  [Ernestine] You're smart, and you're cute. [chuckles]  You don't usually get both of those in the same package.  Usually you only get one or the other.  Oh, thank you very much.  I could say the same thing about Denise.  [Catherine clears throat]  - [Catherine] Thanks. - [Joyce] Mm.  Grandma Ernestine, your yams turned out really nice this year!  You add a little nutmeg?  Hmm?  I said your yams turned out really nice this year!  Did you add a little nutmeg?  She added nutmeg! Don't you ask another fucking question!  Nutmeg, cinnamon, whatever the hell!  You know what go in the damn yams!  I don't have any appreciation for what was going on at my table.  What are you talking about?  If you want to bring your friend over here, that's fine,  but don't be making eyes and rubbing backs and getting all fresh.  - I wasn't doing that. - Oh, yes, you were.  I saw you. I know that look.  Oh, you used to make that look for Rachel from Friends.  I always thought you were looking at Joey.  Joey?  Ma, are you serious? That character was an idiot.  Look, you can be lesbian if you want to,  but when you come up in here, you gonna respect my house.  Problem Child 2.

[sighs]  They said it was a justified use of force.  Oh. That's horrible.  Horrible.  So I was watching the news the other day, and apparently,  there's this bulldog that set a world record  for skateboarding through 30 people's legs.  DD, you seen that clip.  He was going through the legs like  Yeah, that wasn't the news that was on.  That was WorldstarHipHop.  That's the news.  DD, let's take a selfie.  All right.
