How long do you think the wait'll be?  It's gonna be about an hour.  And also the kitchen closes at 10:00 tonight,  so you may not even make it.  I'm so sorry.  What do we do?  I gotta have my tapas. I just gotta.  Me too.  I don't know. Should we wait?  What if the kitchen closes?  Uh, should we just go to the people and say,  "Come on, eat faster, faster"?  That's a good idea.

They're about to leave.  - No. - Look at them. I can tell.  They're sitting there like, "Oh, I can't believe we waited this long for tapas.  I didn't even want tapas."  "What are you talking about? You're the one that suggested tapas."  "No, I suggested Thai food."  "Oh, I can't believe this. I should have never married you.  I should have listened to my father."  See?

Why isn't it a good idea?  You're being a little baby.  What?  "I need to be around her.  We have such good chemistry."  No.  Number one, her bozo fiancÃ©'s gonna be there.  Number two, from now on, you're triple B  busy, beautiful, badass.  Fine.  "I'll try, but I might not make it."  Good.  She's writing back.  She's writing back.  She's writing back to me   "Please come. I really want to see you."  Then she threw in a couple more emojis.  - What kind of emoji? - This guy.  That's huggy, bro.  Get that fucking huggy away from me.  I want kissy,  or I want red hearts only.  Ah, come on, man. Let's just go.  It'll be good to see what's up with them.  All right, I'll go with you. It's fine.  You okay?  I think my Lunesta's kicking in hard,  and I just got to take a little nap.  All right, well, I'll probably head out.  Cap  will you tuck me in?  I'm not tucking you in.  The problem is I don't have my sheets on me, and I'm cold.  Come on, man. I can't tuck you in.  But  maybe I can throw a little blankie on you.  Night-night, buddy.  Night-night.  I'm starting to get a little freaked out.  I think it's gonna be weird seeing her together with him.  Yeah, I told you this was a terrible idea.  But then you agreed it'd be good to check out the vibe.  That was Lunesta Arnold. You never trust that guy.  By the way, thanks for that tuck-in.  - Dev, hey. - Hey, happy birthday, Pino.  Hey, thank you. Nice to see you. Ciao.  - DiGiorno. - Ciao.  So, looks like the who's who of the Northeast tile market here.  Listen, Syed Ahamed is here.  He's the marble king of the Southeast.  Believe me, he's a legend.  Uh, should I ask him about how he did the fireplace  at the Park Hyatt hotel in Shanghai?  No, maybe I mean, it's too obvious. Everybody ask him about that.  - Yeah, probably. - Hey, guys.

He's the king, I told you.  - Carrara is wonderful idea. - That sounds really cool.  I just don't have a fireplace in my apartment.  Oh. What a shame.  If you don't have a fireplace, at least do your kitchen, Arnold.  Yeah. Once he did a countertop for a football player  for the Miami Dolphin. Hmm?  We cut the island in the shape of the dolphin,  and it was very good, means, very good.  Uh, I love lasers.  Wonderful. So?  I'm renting right now,  and I just don't want to put a couple thousand dollars  into a dolphin-shaped countertop.  No, no, no, no, no. It's not expensive.  It's not. You know, at least you can do the bathroom countertops?  Yeah.  Hey! Guys.  Can I humbly request a tile-talk moratorium?  Meaning we talk about anything besides tiles for a little while?  Oh, yes, please.  I'm sorry.  We brought work to the party.  It's It's just I'm I'm overexcited that Syed, you're here!  My friend.

In the future, maybe. - Yes.  You never know with Italians, you know.  - Maybe one day. - Okay.  B-by the way Sorry.  Uh, the countertop in the bathroom, I think it's a good idea.  - Let's do it. - It's cheap, not expensive.  What you think?  Can you cut other animal shapes?  Yeah, with the laser, we can cut anything you want.  And if you have any favorite animals, we can cut it.  Well, I did have a lizard named Lucien  that might look cool there.  We have some green jade. We can put a lizard into the countertop.  - Yeah. - It would look good.  Captain's update.  Look at this.  Whoa.

That's perfect.  Have a couple drinks, do a little dancing.  You know DJ Arnie's supplying those sexy beats.  Mm. That could be good.  Or, I mean, maybe it's better to just  have a private conversation in the apartment.  I like that, too.  But either way,  you got to talk to her from your heart.  I just  I really don't know how I'd say it.  There's something going on.  I can feel it inside.  And I know you can, too.  I know you're engaged, and everything's complicated,  but I had to say something,  'cause if I didn't, I'd regret it for the rest of my life.  Bro, that was very powerful.  If I'm Francesca, I'm giving you kissies, 100%.  Want to run it again?  No, this is getting a little weird.  Want to switch roles?  I mean, I'm not sure why, but sure.  Francesca, there's a chemical bond between us that we cannot deny.  I want to pick you up and carry you away from Pino  and toss you in the ocean  and then give you kissies.  Take my hand and come to the ocean?  Ah, I think I'm probably gonna go with mine.  What'd you like to drink?  Um, can I have just water?  Yeah. Sure.  Staying hydrated?  I think I'm just gonna take it easy tonight.  All right.  Uh, I'm gonna get another drink. Do you want one?  No.  All right, um  I'll wait for you here.  Okay.  You seem tired. You want to You want to grab a Red Bull?  - It'll wake you u - No, I'm okay.  I am fine.  You normally like to dance and stuff.  I'm fine. Just stop taking care of me, okay?  I'm fine.  All right, I'm sorry.  Dude, we got to talk.  Wait. Hold on one second.  Make some noise for DJ Arnie!  - Did you have to do that then? - Yeah, I kind of had to.  Oh, dude, give me the Captain's update.  Captain's update is the ship's fucking sinking.  What?  She's gone cold. Everything's changed.  I don't know. I think she got freaked out or something.  Did we not rehearse enough last night?  - Shit. Talk about something else. - Um  So I was like, "Hey, man, this is not the iguana that you listed.  This is obviously a different lizard."  Hey, guys.  Uh, I'm a bit tired.  I think I'm gonna go back home.  Okay?  Sure. All right.  Dev!  Hey, Kristy, what's up?  Not too much. What are you doing here?  Uh, my buddy Arnold is DJ'ing.  Arnold, this is Kristy. Kristy, Arnold.  DiGiorno.  I got to run, but you should meet up with me later.  My friend's having a party at her yoga studio.  It's their one-year anniversary.  Oh, cool.  Oh, my God, yoga party?  That sounds hot! You mind if Arnold tags along?  You're DJ'ing.  None of this is functional.  I had a playlist cooking the whole time.  - Text me later, okay? - All right, bye.  Uh, all right, well, um, I guess I'll see you later.  I'm probably gonna hang out with Arnold, then maybe go to this yoga thing.  Sure.  Good night.  Bye.  Hey. I thought you were leaving.  Yes, I was about to leave,  but my driver went to the wrong address, so  Mm.  What?  What's wrong with you?  I'm just tired.  So you're tired? That That's what it is?  Yes, I'm really tired.  Well, uh, have fun with Kristy.  Why are you saying it like that?  I don't know.  I didn't think that you would like some girl like her. I mean  - Really? - Yeah.  Well, what kind of girl do you think I should be with?  Well, someone more charming,  funny,  less taller.  - Less taller? - Yeah.  Isn't there a word for that?  Smaller.  Bravo.  Yeah.  So  someone smaller  Mm-hmm.  more charming and funny.  Sound pretty great.  It is.  What if I told you I met someone like that  but they're engaged?  Well, I would say,  it's a tricky situation  but for both of them.  I have to go.  Hey.  Hey.  Um, I'm sorry about tonight.  I need to talk to you.  Can I meet you at your apartment?  Yeah. I-I-I can be there in, like, 20 minutes.  Okay. Thanks.  All right. Bye.  Bye.  I'm sorry.  I've been acting really weird. I'm so sorry.  I'm just confused, you know?  I'm leaving soon, and  and I can't believe it.  I'm really gonna miss you.  I'm really gonna miss you, too.  No, Dev, I'm  really gonna miss you.  I feel sad because I don't want to leave you.  I don't want you to leave.  What are you doing?  Are you trying to kiss me?  I thought you wanted me to. I  Why?  I thought there was something going on between us.  Do you have feelings for me?  Oh, my God, you do have feelings for me.  Oh, no!  No!  Oops.  I thought she actually had feelings for you.  Sorry it didn't work out.  Wow. Oh, wow.  Really? Yes, yes, yes, sir.  Of course. Of cour Yeah, yeah, no problem.  No problem. I can come.  Okay, fantastic. We'll see you on Saturday.  Great. Ciao. Ciao. Grazie. Ciao, ciao.  Washington, DC, did you hear?  The distributor. He wants to meet with me. It's amazing!  That's great.  That's great, exactly  What's going on?  Nothing.  What do you mean, "nothing"?  I tell you good news about the distributor in DC.  You say "fantastic" with an attitude. What the hell's going on, huh?  I've been feeling strange for a while  and you haven't noticed until now.  I never realized, but I'm asking you now, what's going on?  Maybe if you tell me I'll understand.  What's wrong?  I'm scared.  What are you scared of?  I'm scared to go back home.  I love New York so much. I'm happy here.  I've seen tons of things, met tons of people.  The idea of going back to Modena, to our life, scares me to death.  I know we're leaving soon, so what does it mean  if I'm not enthused about going back home?  What does that mean?  What does it mean? I don't know what it means.  You tell me what the fuck it means!  You're saying you want to stay in New York, not go back to Modena.  - That's not what I'm saying. - You just said that!  You said, "I want to stay in New York, I like New York, I've met so many people."  What the fuck does that mean, huh?  I don't know. I don't know.  We are supposed to go back to Modena!  We are supposed to get married! You have to  There's the shop, and all these things. What are you saying?  I don't know.  I don't know. I don't  What does "I don't know" mean? Sorry, but are you serious?  I don't know what I want anymore!  Did something happen?  Huh?  Something happened, I know it.  Nothing happened.  Listen, stop talking shit.  Tell me the truth. I want to understand.  What happened? Tell me, try to explain.  I don't want to talk about it.  Not now.  Not like this, not now  Nothing happened!  You don't want to talk about it, not now, not like this  nothing happened?  What the fuck are you saying?  Do you want to tell me what's going on, please?  Huh?  Don't tell me nothing happened!  Did something happen?  - No. - Do you love someone else?  No!  Tell me the truth, FrancÃ©.  Huh?  Tell me the truth.  Wow, this is so cool.  Look at this.  Yeah, it's nice.  Nice? I mean, it's amazing.  Come on, what's going on with you?  Dev, what's wrong with you?  What's wrong is  I'm in love with you, and you're engaged.  I wasn't expecting you to say that.  Francesca, come on, there's obviously something going on between us, right?  Hey.  What do you want me to say?  I want you to say  that you feel the same way I feel inside  and that I'm not crazy.  Do you?  Yes! I do!  Okay?  I do feel something for you.  I do like you. I probably love you.  I think of you. I dream of you.  When I'm with Pino, I wish he could be you.  But it's not. It's Pino, and I'm with him.  And I'm engaged, and there's nothing I can do about it.  Of course there is.  We can figure this out.  We can.  Francesca, it's your life.  You really want to be with Pino? Is that what you want in your heart?  You can't be lukewarm.  What's "lukewarm"?  It means not hot, not cold. It's in the middle.  I don't want to be lukewarm.  No.  See? I just want to do this with you.  I want to laugh with you. I want to define random English words.  I-I just want to be with you.  You make me so happy, and I think I make you pretty happy, too.  These past few weeks have been so amazing.  And there's so many times I just wanted to grab you and kiss you.  You don't even know.  Well, probably I would have kissed you back.  Hey, guys, just so you know, I can hear everything you're saying,  and it sounds like you're having a fairly intimate conversation.  Just let me know if you'd like to switch over to a private channel.  Can we go somewhere and talk?  Dev, I need you to give me time, okay?  Just give me some time.  We will talk, I promise, but give me time now.  Okay.  Ciao.
